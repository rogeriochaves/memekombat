For example, disrupting the flow of chat in chat rooms with vulgar language, abusiveness, hitting the return key repeatedly, inputting excessively large images so the screen goes by too fast to read, use of excessive SHOUTING (all caps) in an attempt to disturb other users, "spamming," or flooding (continuous posting repetitive text), are all prohibited;</p>

 <br>
<h3>Waiver and Severability</h3>

 <br>
<h3>Injunctive Relief</h3>
<p>You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made hereunder to Meme Kombat are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Meme Kombat and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Meme Kombat shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.</p>
